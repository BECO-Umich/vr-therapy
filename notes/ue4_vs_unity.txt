Unreal Engine 4 vs Unity

Unreal Engine
-More realistic rendering
-More demanding to run
-C++
-Used by larger studios, supports workflows for larger groups of people
-Open source, access to source code
-Better for polished graphics


Unity
-Soft-Dreamy look
-Easier to run
-C#
-Better for small community projects
-Black box, mysterious, can’t access source code
-Better for apps and 2d stuff

Main differences: Unreal Engine has c++ which most people at Umich are more familiar with, while Unity uses c# which is simpler but less commonly
used in Umich. Unreal Engine is open source and you can see the code where Unity is not and you have to do stuff in their framework. Unity
was more common in the past but they are pretty close now in that they are both used and both have a lot of educational resources / tutorials.
Unreal engine used to be clearly better for graphics but Unity has made a lot of improvements and they’re pretty even now in that as well. Unity
is less demanding than unreal engine but unreal engine generally looks and runs better than unity. I think unreal engine wins out as the
coding language is more familiar to UMICH students, it’s open source giving us a better understanding and more control over it, and it’s generally
seen as a more professional platform for larger studios compared to the more indie use of Unity, and it is generally better for 3d vr stuff while
unity is better for 2d and apps. While unreal engine is more demanding, it also is more robust.

Unreal engine offers 2 different types of licenses: Publishing and creators. Both are free to use but publishing will let us monetize it if that’s
something we potentially want to do.
