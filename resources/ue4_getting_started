To begin working in the Unreal Engine 4 the first step is to download the Epic Games Launcher, then to download UE4 from within the launcher.

When creating your first project, you may get stuck at 39% with your cpu running at 100% performance. This is not a bug, you just need to wait
and after the first project this shouldn't happen again. When you get into the actual project it will compile some additional resources.

Then UE4 will walk you through a short tutorial introducing several parts of the UI.

After this tutorial it'll be pretty overwhelming what to work on next. The unreal engine website has an online learning section with many useful tutorials.

I've been building some more confidence by following along with these tutorials. Following the prompt to get started and looking at your dashboard,
some beginning tutorials will have been picked out like a tour through the portal, an introduction, and a first hour guide for UE4. Some other 
useful tutorials include those related to blueprints like "Blueprints - Essential Concepts" or "Converting Blueprints to C++."

It's encouraged to explore anything that seems useful or interesting and can potentially help our final product.
